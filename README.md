# HOOTSim: N-Body Simulator

## Overview ##
Welcome to HOOTSim, the N-Body Simulator crafted with precision and a touch of whimsy by John and Adam, two wise Owl gentlemen who are serious statisticians and coders but also like to have a good time. HOOTSim allows you to simulate the gravitational interactions of celestial bodies in a visually appealing and scientifically accurate manner.

## Features ##
Realistic N-Body Simulation: Experience the gravitational dance of celestial bodies as they interact with each other in a dynamic and accurate simulation.

# Customizable Parameters: Adjust parameters such as gravitational constants, initial positions, and velocities to create unique and captivating simulations.

# Stunning Visualization: HOOTSim provides a visually engaging representation of celestial bodies' movements, making it easy to observe and analyze complex interactions.

# Educational and Research-Friendly: Ideal for educational purposes and research in astrophysics, physics, and computer science.

# Developed by Owl Gentlemen: Crafted with care and expertise by John and Adam, two Owl gentlemen with a passion for statistics, coding, and a good time.
